									<h1>How did I become<br />
									an artist?</h1>
									<p>Allow me to begin at the inception of my artistic journey. From a young age, I harbored an unwavering passion for creating artworks, a sentiment that continues to thrive within me. 
										To this day, I possess my collection of drawings meticulously preserved from my early childhood in 2009 when I was six years old.</p>
								</header>

								<p>Displayed here is a captivating self-portrait created in an animated style, serving as anonther example of my artistic prowess. Throughout my early years, I immersed myself in a vast selection of animated shows, including beloved classics such as Tom & Jerry, One Piece, Dragonball Z, Sonic X, and more. These shows continue to serve me as a well of inspiration, fueling my artistic endeavors to this day.

								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/jun.jpg" alt=""/></span>
									Inspiration is the lifeblood of my creative journey, serving as the driving force behind my progress as an illustrator. Speaking of inspiration, there are four people that had a huge influence on me and my art: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/takano.aya/?hl=en">Aya Takano</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West">Kanye West</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/takashipom/">Takashi Murakami</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/madmagicorchestra/?hl=en/">Jun Inagawa</a>, who I was fortunate enough to meet in Japan :)
									From the dynamic and expressive character designs to the meticulous composition of my artworks, the influence of animated shows and Japanese culture can be felt, lending a unique and captivating essence to my artistic expressions.
								</p>

								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/1.jpg" alt="" /></span>Presented here is one of my earliest artistic creations. During that period, I was a huge Sonic fanatic and often drew him. I know these drawings looks goofy, but I'm glad that I still own these because I can always self-reflect and see how I improved. Self-reflection is the greates art of progression.</p>

								<div class="image right"><img src="images/2.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>My journey of improvement in drawing has been a testament to perseverance, dedication, and a burning passion for artistic expression. Through countless hours of practice and a steadfast commitment to honing my skills, I have witnessed a tangible evolution in my abilities. Starting from humble beginnings, I embarked on a continuous quest for knowledge, studying the fundamentals of drawing, anatomy, and perspective. 
									With each passing day, I find myself armed with greater confidence, honed technical skills, and an unwavering belief in the transformative power of art.
								</p>

								<div class="image left"><img src="images/3.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>During that period, I devoted myself to daily drawing sessions, utilizing every available moment to refine my skills. As time progressed, I found myself in need of replenishing my art supplies, causing a pivotal realization. This thought resonated within me: "How cool it would be to possess an endless amount  of pens so I do not have to buy new ones!" This childhood aspiration took a sudden turn when I stumbled upon the realm of digital art equipment while researching the best tools available. The discovery of a digital drawing tablet sparked a remarkable idea, propelling my artistic journey forward at an accelerated pace.

								</p>
							
								<div class="image right"><img src="images/CLEANBOSS 2.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>This is one of my first digital art drawings. 
									Embracing the digital realm as my 'new piece of paper', I embarked on a transformative journey of growth and improvement. Initially navigating the intricacies of digital tools and software, I immersed myself in countless hours of experimentation, familiarizing myself with digital brushes, layers, 
									and various techniques unique to this medium.
								</p>
								<div class="image left"><img src="images/flowerboy.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Fueled by the supportive online art community, I gained the confidence to showcase my creations on social media like Twitter, allowing my art to reach a broader audience.
									The positive response and attention received from fellow artists and enthusiasts (homage to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dyvblo/">Dyvblo</a> for supporting me since day one) provided the much-needed affirmation and encouragement to further refine my skills and dive deeper into my artistic exploration. 
									As my online presence grew, I seized the opportunity to leverage my newfound recognition and began receiving commissions, transforming my passion into a rewarding professional endeavor. I am grateful for the journey that led me to this point and excited to continue expanding my digital art repertoire while connecting with a diverse range of clients who appreciate and value my unique artistic vision.
								</p>
								<div class="image right"><img src="images/Danke-FuÌˆr-Alles.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Through unwavering determination and countless hours of dedicated practice, I witnessed a rapid improvement in my digital art skills. 
									The passion that fueled my creative pursuits soon transformed into tangible success as I began receiving more and more commissions. With each commission completed, I saved my earnings, setting aside funds to invest in the tools of my dreams: An Ipad with Procreate. </p>
								<div class="image left"><img src="images/SCARLXRD.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Creating illustrations for DJs, musicians and artists has been an exhilarating and fulfilling experience, allowing me to merge my love for art with the dynamic world of music. As a passionate artist, I seized the opportunity to collaborate with <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/projects.html">these talented individuals</a>, translating their music into captivating visual expressions.
									
								</p>
								<div class="image fit"><img src="images/fab.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>With great anticipation, I can't wait for the future prospects that this art journey holds for my life. I embrace the commitment to continuous improvement, dedicating myself to honing my craft with each passing day.</p>
